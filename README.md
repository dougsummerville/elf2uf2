# elf2uf2
 an ELF to UF2 utility written in Python for the Pi Pico

This is a standalone python program that will convert a valid Pi Pico 32-bit ARM little-endian ELF binary to a UF2 file format for programming (it may work for other .elf formats as well).  It can be added to bare-metal Pico projects without requiring other dependences for programming(except for Python).
